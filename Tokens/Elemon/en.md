Description:

*The article is a point of view from author Lu An - a member of RADA Community, on **Elemon** and its potential.* 

## **1. Project Introduction**

**Vietnamese blockchain Pikachu?**

*Pokemon* is a very familiar game to most people all over the world. In fact, *Pokemon Go* is one of the most *commercially successful games ever*. With mysterious, cute, and interesting creatures, it has become a part of the childhood of almost every single child in the world in the last 25 years, through cartoons, card games, and a myriad of different game titles. With the recent boom of Blockchain Gaming (*#gamefi*), a group of game developers from Vietnam revived "*a sky of nostalgia*" from their own childhoods as well, and decided to create and develop a *Pokemon*-inspired game called **Elemon**.

**Elemon** seeks to improve the limitations of the traditional gaming industry with transparency, inclusion, governance, and Play2Earn (P2E) which is fundamentally the value addition to *Pokemon*, where players spend 1000â€™s of dollars every single year, without ever receiving a return on their investment.

The game is built on *Binance Smart Chain*, which is a world with powerful beings called **Elemon**. Players, in that world, will play a character capable of summoning, capturing, or leading *Elemons* to fight each other, the plot is quite similar to Pokemon.

**Elemon** also has existing competitors and the two largest in focus currently is dominating Ronin (*Axie*) and Binance / KardiaChain (*My DeFi Pet*) with years in the market, being pioneers, the potential for Elemon is very big to reach their level, but a mass-market adaptation of Play2Earn has only just started, both old and new players in the industry, like **Elemon**, will have the perfect timing in terms of the explosion of user pickup in the #gamefi industry in the coming years, the global market potential is hardly at 1% yet.

## **2. Market Review**

**Elemon's** game genre is not new in the market today, in fact, there are many similar Blockchain-based Game projects that have been successful and have been leading the #gamefi industry. Competition is fierce, and we can see a good potential advantage in terms of market capitalization. **Elemon** has a *small initial market cap ($268,200)*, compared to its competitors, forecasted to increase Elemon's value in the future (*deflationary*) if the team does well and launch a good product where the Play2Earn creates enough value for the players to find spending time on a cute game like Elemon *worth their time*.

At the end of the day, the #gamefi industry comes down to one thing:

Who can *reward time spent* and *contribution* (*play2earn, stake2earn, governance2earn, content2earn, allowance4play, write2earn, etc.*) in the most meaningful way for the Player?

For a better look, let's review two typical similar projects that lead the way for the new generation that is coming now: *Axie Infinity*, and *My DeFi Pet*.

### **Axie Infinity**

**![Axs](https://gql.dhunt.io/media/assets/a49e9c90-3adf-43dc-b4be-ec5c57b79de1?format=webp&width=1080)**

With a market cap of $4.27 billion on August 11, 2021, Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens) game that allows players to breed, raise, and battle creatures, mystical objects called Axies.

### **My DeFi Pet**

**![My Pet Defi](https://gql.dhunt.io/media/assets/4b3fc58d-f820-421b-aefe-102b65045e8d?format=webp&width=1080)**

My Defi Pet has a market cap of $7.86 billion as of August 13, 2021, is a decentralized virtual pet game developed by TopeBox on two ecosystems Binance Smart Chain and KardiaChain.

## **3. Product Review**

**Elemon**, in comparison with other *competitors*, is adding more innovation with a combination of NFT technology with a new genre of #play2earn game called *IDLE RPG*.
*IDLE RPG* enables players to earn money but need neither spending hours in front of the screen nor burning power having the computer turned on overnight- this has a huge mass-market potential!

As time spent vs. reward is at the very core of the value proposition that #play2earn offers to the global mass market, Elemon is tapping into a very interesting new aspect of #play2earn in this sub-genre.

*Players* summon the **Elemons** and lead them in the fight to restore peace in the world - and earn *rewards* on battles or by staking Elemon to earn more through their contribution either in the form of time spent or NFT staked back into the game.

Players just need to perform a few simple steps and their squad will automatically fight for them, also when they are offline. A highly appreciated feature, as offline, players continue to receive the same rewards as they would need to be online in the competitor's games. 

With a fascinating storyline of thousands of diverse NFT Characters, that are all very cute and adorable, the world of Elemon will open up a meaningful customer journey of discovery, combat, and earnings.

### **Summon**

**![Summon](https://gql.dhunt.io/media/assets/1648aeef-10de-44b5-a2a1-b3c9835ad63c?format=webp&width=1080)**

There are many methods for the player to summon the **Elemons**. Each **Elemon** will have some stats such as HP, STR, INT... **Elemon** can increase stats when: level up, increase star stats. **Elemon**, besides initial skills, will be upgraded after a certain level or condition.

### **Ranking**

**![Ranking](https://gql.dhunt.io/media/assets/51fab862-d089-4da9-be01-481752a43f25?format=webp&width=1080)**

*Players* can participate in top racing, battle... with other players to promote and win attractive rewards. *Players* can lead 5 **Elemons** for maximum to fight.

### **Equipment**

**![Gear](https://gql.dhunt.io/media/assets/5ba8033b-0336-4d6b-81a6-b245fc3e1d88?format=webp&width=1080)**

Equipping **Elemon** with additional accessories will increase its power stats. Each **Elemon** has a total of 6 types of equipment corresponding to the HP, P.ATK, M.ATK, P.DEF, M.DEF, and Speed stats. **Elemon** Game will gradually launch each of that equipment according to the updated plan in the *Roadmap*.

### **Tasks**

**![Mission](https://gql.dhunt.io/media/assets/93469963-addb-48fb-8c5f-69d94f3c06b4?format=webp&width=1080)**

The **Elemon** system will automatically assign tasks to players including daily, weekly, and monthly tasks. The reward will correspond to the level of the assigned task, the higher the level of the task, the more attractive the reward.

### **Shop**

A place to sell accessories to upgrade **Elemon** as well as equip them.

### **Evolution**

**![Picture1](https://gql.dhunt.io/media/assets/a1b655f7-af12-4224-b291-ca5aad62f188?format=webp&width=1080)**

When the **Elemons** reach a certain level and star, the *Player* can conduct hybridization to evolve into a completely new **Elemon** with appearance and stats which are superior to the old **Elemon**. *Players* need to use *$ELMON* tokens to use this feature.

### **Events**

**![Picture1](https://gql.dhunt.io/media/assets/87e8d6d3-e432-4d34-9525-63cc9bd8f0b0?format=webp&width=1080)**

Based on the *Player* level ranking, **Elemon** level, and combat strength, **Elemon** **Game** will organize top racing events with great rewards.

## **4. Unique Selling Points**

**Elemon** will help users access Blockchain technology via the following unique strategies:

- Tokenization of game characters (**Elemons**).
- Play-to-earn model, besides entertainment, allows players to earn high-value, profitable accessories.
- The platform is open to everyone, no matter the level of technology or technique
- The revenue-based model can be maintained to limit the inflation of Tokens as well as accessories in **Elemon**.

**Elemon** aspires to bring about a plan to revolutionize the blockchain world by bringing collections of creatures, including rare creatures and NFTs to use in the game world. With it, more and more people can access and improve knowledge. Make it possible for everyone to see how the evolution of blockchains industry development can be used outside of the financial sector.

## **5. Tokenomics**

### **Utilities**

- **Farming**: The **ELMON** token is used for farming points that users can use to convert NFT.
- **Payment**: **ELMON** tokens are used as a payment currency in NFT Marketplace along with other tokens.

### **Token Allocation**

**![Screenshot 35](https://gql.dhunt.io/media/assets/ca958bda-438d-4789-97f0-b885109f250f?format=webp&width=1080)**

In general, the tokens are also fairly distributed. However, early-stage funding rounds such as *Private* and *Seed* accounted for a bit more than the average of other projects, meaning that nearly 20% of the tokens were in the hands of early investors. This can lead to a strong fluctuation in the token's price after releasing, posing a risk to those investors who come later.

### **Vesting Schedule**

**![Screenshot 32](https://gql.dhunt.io/media/assets/3b0b49e8-842b-4406-90e8-d6c15c55bd13?format=webp&width=1080)**

The schedule is quite good, the team and advisor are tied for a relatively long time compared to other projects. This can be a way for the project to show its commitment to *investors*.

## **6. Roadmap**

**![Picture1](https://gql.dhunt.io/media/assets/e711d113-e177-4c3d-94e7-76f64db70c92?format=webp&width=1080)**

So, the project's token will be sold and IDO this quarter, let's wait and see how the value of *$ELMON* will fluctuate? In general, the Roadmap is quite short, the project is in the process to achieve many milestones in a short time, however, this may reduce the quality of the product long term, on the other hand, it may be a very *agile* way of *learning as you go* to *adjust* to the reactions in the *market*, and that might not be a bad idea considering the mass-market adaptation that has really begun, and the potential **Elemon** has in this new *IDLE RPG* sub-genre.

## **7. Media**

For a new project like Elemon, the above numbers are also quite impressive. For any investor, profit is a prerequisite. If any project has a good communication team, it can push the token price up in the short term, bring profit quickly, so this is also an aspect that many investors are interested in.

## **10. Summary**

**Elemon** ventures into the *IDLE RPG* sub-genre, which is new, but has huge potential.

If the *Team* behind **Elemon** can continue to carry the project through storytelling, as they do now, it is clear that the global market potential for **Elemon** is there - it will come down to the execution.

**Elemon** *stands out,* due to its *storytelling*, due to the fact that these guys grew up playing *Pokemon*, due to the fact that the story comes out of *nostalgia* from *childhood memories* - when a *Narrative* for an *up-start company* is as *cohesive* as is the case for **Elemon**, they have the most fundamental element in place to *succeed globally*.

Can the *Team* execute and realize this *potential*?

That is what we will learn in the coming months as **Elemon** *launches*, but this will be a very interesting project to follow, as they divert from the *competitors* both new and old, and venture into *IDLE RPG*.
