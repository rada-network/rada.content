### **Hero Model**

Hero Model is the outside look of a hero. One hero has a few different model versions that will decide the differences in the active skill of that hero.  
_For example, a Shadow has three model versions as in the picture below: version 1 has less armor, version 2 is added armor on thighs, and version 3 is added a lanyard in the back. Those differences in model versions will lead to the differences in Shadow’s active skill in each version._  
Specifically, Shadow version 1 will have an active skill of dealing single damage that equals to six times his Attack Power and increases dodge rate by 30% in 2 turns. Shadow version 2 will have an active skill of dealing single damage that equals six times his Attack Power and increases dodge rate by 100% in 1 turn. Likewise, Shadow version 3’s active skill is dealing single damage that equals ten times his ATK, healing 25% HP, and increasing dodge rate by 30% in 2 turns.

### Element

Element is shown by the matching items of a hero in the GamePlay. Heroes come in four elements: Blue, Red, Green, and Purple. A hero will attack when the corresponding element is matched and disappears in the gameplay.

### Hometown

Hometown is represented by the background image on the hero card. Heroes from different hometowns will have different Attack Power and Health Point. For example, a hero from Snow Mountain — a common hometown, will have its in-game ATK increased by 1% and its in-game HP increased by 4%.

### Pet

Each hero will have a pet that follows him/her and determines his/her passive skill. For example, when a hero carries a fox — a rare pet, he/she will receive two circle red bombs as a passive spell at the beginning of the battle.

### Crypto Medal

Each hero will be tied to one topcoin including BTC, ETH, ADA, USDT, HER, BNB, XRP, SOL, and DOT. The strength of the hero will increase and decrease in proportion to the price movement of the coin in 24 hours.

This is an interesting point in the game. So how can players own Heroes in Heroverse? Here are 4 ways that players can address:

-   Trading: You can buy and sell Hero with HER tokens on Marketplace
-   Hero box: You can open Hero Box with a chance to receive Hero
-   Staking: You can get a reward Hero by Staking token (you will get Hero within the first 10 days after launching the Staking campaign)
-   Creating: You can create 1 Hero by combining 4 Hero pieces and HER tokens (after winning the game challenges).

There is a series of battles with levels of difficulty in order. Each stage will include waves of monsters for the player to destroy. Participating in each stage, players will have the task of leading their Heroes to battle and bring back the loot after each victory.

In a battle, the player is required to have all 4 Heroes, it is not mandatory for the Heroes to be all different. In each battle, players will be provided with a table full of symbols including colors:  
Blue, Red, Green, Violet

![Battle1](https://gql.dhunt.io/media/assets/dc5ba51f-3e8d-4a32-9f35-145049e2c17d?width=1080)

To be able to destroy enemies in each stage, the player needs to create the longest possible sequence of symbols to activate the attack mode of the heroes.

![Battle2](https://gql.dhunt.io/media/assets/79a79645-324b-4e42-ad8e-aebd31c6dd17?width=1080)

Players can pick the enemy by clicking on the opponent they want to fight. Every time the link of symbols is formed, the Hero of the respective system will upgrade more mana (below the health bar). When the player has aggregated enough mana for the Hero, the player can click on the Hero to switch to active mode. In case the player's squad has only one type, connecting symbols from different types on the table will not activate the attack mode for those Heroes.

Instead, if the player matches the icon of the Hero type correctly, the damage will be x4, otherwise, the amount of mana received will be divided equally among 4 Heroes. After the battle, Heroes will lose stamina and need time to recover before entering a new battle.

### Upgrade Hero

To upgrade a Hero, you must win campaigns and use HES tokens. The more upgraded Heroes, the more power they have. However, the next upgrade will cost more than the previous ones.

### **Awake Hero:**

Hero's strength will depend on their rarity and how many times they are upgraded. However, when the Hero reaches the level cap, you will need to use the "awakening system" to help the Hero break the limit. To awaken the Hero, you will have to use the HER token. When you awaken your Hero, you will be rewarded with Hero Shard (HRS).

### **Playing strategy**

**Heroes are divided into 3 main roles: Damage dealer, Tanker, Supporter.**

-   Damage dealers are heroes with high ATK, its skills can generate large amounts of damage. For example Shinobi, Arrondoff
-   Tanker are heroes with high HP, their skills increase defense for themselves and the team.  
    For example Abbadon
-   Supporter type is the strong hero in terms of skills to control opponents and support both attack and defense for the team. For example Dryad
-   A squad does not have to have all 4 types or all roles. It depends on characters and strategies of players.

**Activities in the game**

## **4. Unique Features:**

**Play and Earn model:**

With the replacement of Play to Earn model to Play and Earn model, Heroverse aims to focus more on gameplay and improve the player's experience besides being able to earn money instead of playing just to make money.

![4f4c4d51 C8ad 4677 991c 9a796d75fe15](https://gql.dhunt.io/media/assets/99041400-1c29-4ec4-862b-f029eb6a37de?width=1080)

Players will earn money by receiving Hero essence (HES) tokens. In addition to receiving HES tokens from daily tasks and campaigns, the special feature of the game is that players compete directly with each other in daily Bosses. Boss will be gradually opened when the player completes 1 chapter. The newest boss will have the most attractive reward. Boss will constantly change every day forcing players to be flexible in using tactics.

## **5. Tokenomic**

**Token HER và HES (Hero essence)**

### **Token HES and token inflation in-game**

HES is the monetary system in Heroverse. It also is a side token system used in Heroverse ecosystems.

-   Token HES has a limitless supply, so players can earn HES easily by playing games and use it for transactions. As a result, the huge token supply in-game can lead to inflation. To mitigate this, the game developers allow players to use HES to upgrade their heroes, thereby decreasing the circulating tokens in the game.
-   Bedsides, HeroVerse players are able to manage the number of heroes through Upgrade Systems, which manages the numbers of token HES and Heroes. In detail, the higher the power level of the hero player wants to upgrade, the higher cost they have to pay. As a result, players must consider carefully in selecting their hero and planning upgrade strategy. Therefore, the Upgrade System can tackle token inflation by balancing the numbers of players, heroes, and token supply.

### **Token HER is Heroverse’s native token**

HER’s main functions are: Management and Buy Hero and Gacha (Lucky Circle)
