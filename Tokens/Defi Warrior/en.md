Description: 

_The article is a point of view from author Alex Ace - a member of RADA Community, on DefiWarrior and its potential._

## **1. Project introduction**

**DeFi Warrior** is a Defi x NFT blockchain-based game genre inspired by the universe of cryptocurrencies where each Warrior is a crypto and each planet is a blockchain. Defi Warrior brings blockchain elements into the game and re-creates a blockchain world in miniature to help players both play the game and better understand how blockchain works in a fascinating way.

In **DeFi Warrior**, each blockchain is a planet, and each crypto is a warrior. The planet is also the place where warriors can build their coin mining factory, and fight against bosses or enemies for rewards. Such game dynamics aim to achieve two essential goals: to bring the world of crypto to the masses through gaming and to pique the curiosity of both gamers and crypto investors.

Each warrior is an NFT, which represents a crypto in the crypto world. By owning warriors, game players can now participate in game modes including farming, mining, player vs player battles, and championships. The warrior can be leveled up to maximize the benefit for warrior owners. The warrior's strength is driven in part by the movement of cryptocurrency prices. This special feature will probably make the battle more dramatic than ever.

**DeFi Warrior** aims to create a blockchain game ecosystem, where warriors can do cross-game play, meaning any warrior can easily enter different gameplays. To that end, **DeFi Warrior** will become decentralized, where players and community can contribute to a warrior and a planet design, and add more gameplay to the DeFi Warrior crypto world.

This is how the team behind **DeFi Warrior** presents the project in their  [whitepaper](https://defiwarrior-1.gitbook.io/defi-warrior/).

In the following sections, we will review each main aspect of the game and try to give a broad view into what **DeFi Warrior** is and _why_ it has market potential.

## 2.  **Market Review**

Recent statistics from statista.com reveal that the value of the game market worldwide has increased significantly over the past decade and is forecast to **grow** over the **$200 billion** mark in **2023**. The overall capitalization of the NFT market reached over $22 billion in 2021, up from $338 million in late 2020. Much of the given sector is being focused on the gaming industry, which has immense potential for providing gamers with unique opportunities for collecting in-game items. (_Source: Binance.com)_

**#Gamefi is exploding** and one of the main reasons is that it attracts traditional gamers to blockchain, especially as we can see now **BSC** (_Binance Smart Chain_) with its **low gas fees** and very **easy onboarding**, **accessibility,** and not to forget the **huge amount** of potential customers already engaged in the Binance ecosystem - which is an essential first step towards mass-market adaptation.

Games like **My DeFi Pet**, **Elemon** (backed by RADA), **Faraland**, **Heroverse  (backed by RADA)****, Knight War, Heroes & Empire,** and **DeFi Warrior  (backed by RADA)** are all part of this new generation of #gamefi #play2earn blockchain games coming out of a Vietnamese _power-hub_ for #gamefi - a growing blockchain gaming industry globally where Vietnam might very well become the **#Gamefi Capital of the world**, something RADA strongly supports as part of our mission.

New players are also seen on **Cardano** and especially from Vietnam, we see **Thetan Arena** is getting a lot of attention on their recent IDO.

Across all of the _new games_ coming out on **BSC** and **Cardano** we also see them launching **NFT Marketplaces** very early, if not as the **very first thing** they do. The Marketplace currency is always in the games own currency across all the new #gamefi releases, a very important point to make and observation to always make: if the NFT Marketplace is not in the games own currency, there will be little chance of establishing the long term tokenomic balance, that is vital for the long term success of any game (or gaming company).

Both **BSC** and **Cardano** offer smart contracts, side chains, and far more competitive pricing on gas, which are primary factors towards mass-market adaptation - leaving pioneers like **Axie Infinity** behind on **Ronin**, still using wrapped ETH (_$WETH_) as its marketplace currency and even with the new bridge to **Binance** for _$AXS_ and _$SLP_ to **Ronin**, and with the new staking feature for _$AXS_ there are still major challenges to deal with for the **Axie Infinity** team to bring the game back towards mass-market growth, once again.  
  
The #gamefi industry is on the verge of real mass-market adaptation, those who emerge as winners will potentially have millions of customers, who are players, who are #play2earn - will **DeFi Warrior** be one of those in the future?

Out of the selection of the new players who are emerging now and are in the process of launching their first #play2earn games during Q4 2021, there seems to already be some essential differences emerging - **2 groups are splitting out**: the first group very quickly gains traction to a level around $2 USD per token while the second group seems to be doing very slow incremental growth.  
  
Digging into the **transactions** in terms of buying and selling the main **token** itself, but also looking in the **NFT contracts** and their **transactions** - and then correlating the two factors - there seems to be a _tendency_ where some of the new #gamefi games have a _tendency_ towards higher “real player transactions”.

This is heavily supported also if the stake contracts are analyzed, the new games with a very high “staking” degree, where the players who buy the NFT stake them back into the game, show very strong _tendencies_ towards long-term sustainability.  
  
However, from an investor perspective of _high risk_ looking for **quick gains**, this is not the category to seek. Instead, the first group seems to attract a high percentage of crypto investors and speculators who are riding the tokens as they launch which could lead to quick gains financially, but how will a starting point of $2 impact mass-market adaptation?

## **3. Product Review**

**DeFi Warrior** is a #gamefi game that sells **NFT**s to potential **players**. The game will have a full eco-system with _tokenomics_ and _game mechanisms_ for **creating**, **buying**, **selling**, **multiplying**, **playing**, **staking,** and **lending out** the **NFT** so that the **investment** into the NFT comes back over time in the form of a return of the initial investment.  
**DeFi Warrior** also offers the opportunity to **stake** in either _$FIWA_ or _$CWIG_ (_which is earned in-game_).

### **DeFi Warrior eco-system**

Basic Decentralized Financial Instruments: **Swaps & Liquidity** _(not released yet)_

-   **Swap:** Helps users convert cryptocurrencies quickly.
-   **Liquidity:** Helps users to add 2 cryptocurrencies to the liquidity pool and get LP tokens

Players in addition to adding LP tokens to the pool, NFT Warrior is also defaulted as a condition to join _the feed_ and receive a new token called  _$___CW_IG_.

### **Warrior NFTs**

#### **NFTs are the property of the player, NFTs include:**

The Warriors, Body Parts, and Game Equipment (accessories).  
Accessories will be divided into rarity levels: Common, Rare, Mythic, Legendary, and God.

#### **How to own Warriors NFTs?**

NFT warriors will become game characters that can go to battle and level up their strength. When created, these NFTs initially will have the same price (_320 $FIWA_). Each NFT represents a coin and has its own characteristics (biological characteristics) similar to the strength of that coin.

The first **PURE** Warriors released is of 6 different types (_BTC, BCH, LTC_ on _Planet Bitcoin_ and _ETH, UNI, BNB_ on _Planet Ethereum_) and 1000 PURE NFT Warriors of each type has been released now: creating the first 6000 Warriors (almost) that are now distributed amongst the **first player base**.  
  
Having a limited amount of PURE original warriors is all part of driving **desire**, **need** and **demand** through **scarcity**, as seen in all the world's biggest gaming successes in the last decade.  
  
As of 04/10/2021 10:00 (GMT+7) around 2-3 weeks before the actual game launches, there are _119_ out of _5889_  **NFT Warriors** only who are for sale on the Marketplace. The currency is $FIWA and the _minimum price_ is nearing 10.000 _$FIWA_ which puts the lowest-priced NFT at **$235 USD** currently (_x30_) - but more **importantly,** that means that **98% of ALL NFT**s are **staked** in-game.  
  
**Top 3 best-selling NFTs on the marketplace:**

1.  199.000 $FIWA ($5000 USD)
2.  70.000 $FIWA ($1750 USD)
3.  65.000 $FIWA ($1625 USD)

A player can own multiple NFTs of the same or different types, there is no limitation.

#### **Players can buy at:**

-   Community Portal
-   Loyalty Portal
-   NFT Marketplace

**As all Warriors have been claimed/sold from both the Community Portal and the Loyalty Portal, the only NFT Warriors that remain are the ones on the NFT Marketplace currently.**

#### **NFT body parts & Accessories**

NFT warriors have body parts that are also NFT’s and they have accessories. The combination of body parts is very interesting in terms of the Fork functionality to potentially fork any Warrior up to 5 times if you are lucky enough to win fork tags in the PVP game.  
Both offer additional dimensions of desire, need, demand through scarcity (rarity) which is also an essential part of building a long term eco-socio-tokenomics balance

### **Other blockchain mechanisms**

#### **DAO Administration**

Ecosystem governance and voting rights

#### **The first Initial Gaming Offering (IGO)**

The platform allows game publishers to raise crowdfunding by issuing tokens in the FIWA ecosystem.

## **4. Unique Selling points**

### **Technology**

Currently, Smart Contract is written in the high-level Solidity language.

The warriors, body parts, or other game accessories created in NFT forms will use the BEP-721 token standard. In the future, DeFi Warrior may adopt other NFT token standards to increase asset pooling. **The additional use of these token standards is a factor that helps the Game reach more users in the future.**

Currently, with the development on the BSC platform, this game will inherit the outstanding features of the platform such as very low gas fees.

### **About the story**

The story is quite good and logically connects the game world and the world of Cryptocurrencies.

The strength of the game character will vary depending on the Planet/Cryptocurrencies it represents and change with the development of Cryptocurrencies will create an interesting surprise in the game.

### **Game mechanics**

The game mechanism is a flexible combination of Fi and NFT arrays. Users have the opportunity to invest NFT assets, increase the number of FIWA, CWIG coins held through 3 activities: gaming, financial activities and NFT trading and exchange.

As can be easily seen, DeFi Warrior currently has a very strong fan base, loyally supporting each project's progress. The reason may come from the extremely impressive and unique storyline of the "Crypto Warriors" or "Blockchain Planet",... which made the fan believe in the future and potential of the founding team and their project. And having a strong, loyal fan base will help the project's token be easily pushed up in a short time. As we all know, in the blockchain world, traffic and loyal fans are the prerequisites for successful projects.

## **10. Summary**

**Big potential and very interesting to follow**.

The team behind **DeFi Warrior** is very experienced and walks in the learned lessons from pioneer Axie Infinity.

The industry segment & culture in Vietnam is very strong

_Mark Dao_, leads product dev with his experience from **Smart Game Studio** - a branch of **Bab Group**. _Victor Truong_, the CEO has a background with serial successful mobile game launches behind him as well, but once we look at the overall partners and backers behind **DeFi Warrior** it becomes clear that it is a serious contender.  
  
**DeFi Warrior** seems to be developed out of, or in part based on, the game “_Kick The Man”_ a previous release from the studio, and it would seem also many of the Bosses in **PvE** are also inherited from many characters in other titles from the game Studio. Having generalized experiences with characters, storytelling, marketing, etc. within the same story-universe tends to improve the chances of success, by building on earlier learned lessons.

_$FIWA_ is very interesting, it’s almost an outlier right now, it has a very high degree of actual player-based transactions and it’s fully supported by the NFT transactions as well.  
  
**DeFi Warrior** seems to be building a real player base slowly and steadily, this could lead towards a very _sustainable long term investment_, considering where _$FIWA_ is today: if it catches up to its “colleagues” launching in the same generation (Q4 2021) of around $2 USD price level, the potential is very big.

NFTs getting close to sold out on the Marketplace rising prices, 110.000 players signed up for test net game 2 weeks ago followed up by half a million sign-ups in the CoinCapMarket Airdrop competition last week, **DeFi Warrior** continues to expand its market position and the following weeks towards the #play2earn game launch will offer some very interesting insights as to the future for this project.
