
_The article is a point of view from author Lan Tran - a member of RADA Community, on dareNFT - the project is expected to be the pioneer in NFT 2.0 in Vietnam._

##**1/ Introduction of DareNFT**

NFT is a familiar subject to those of you who are interested in blockchain, as well as NFT projects, NFT marketplaces sprouting quickly on many different platforms. In addition, NFT is growing quickly in NFT game projects.

On this occasion, I will write an article about the DareNFT project because DareNFT is targeting the NFT game market. DareNFT has developed the NFT 2.0 protocol to solve the problem between NFTs relationships more effectively and reduce the risk of NFT ownership.![Capture7](https://gql.dhunt.io/media/assets/8876a631-110f-4844-b9b3-302db4562ead?width=1080)  

##**2/ Market Review**

The purpose of **DareNFT** is to reinforce reflection among NFTs. For example, there are assets that are born from other assets, called derivative assets, and these assets have a beneficial relationship with each other. For example, a book is translated from English to Vietnamese, or a game item created from other items, or a song covered or remixed from other songs, these assets are all related. However, if that song is an NFT and mapped into the blockchain, the blockchain does not yet reflect the relationship between those because NFT 1.0 cannot do that yet.

Secondly, NFT currently only allows one person to be the sole owner of an asset, but in reality, an asset can be created by many people or contributing capital to buy that asset. That's why currently, on the blockchain, there will only be 1 owner, but in reality, the owners have to make contracts to divide assets with each other and that is contrary to the purpose of the blockchain as working automatically.

Owning NFT is very risky because NFT is unique, non-replaceable, and divisible, so its liquidity is very low. Furthermore, if we just hold the NFT and sell it when the price goes up then we may run into a problem of not knowing when the price will rise. Also, since we are holding NFT, we cannot generate any cash flow from it. Therefore, NFT becomes a liability because it is holding our capital. Our problem is not being able to lease those NFTs.

There are competitors in the market and the two main players currently would be  _Yield Guild Games_  (who are massively in #play2earn and started in  _Axie Infinity_).

## **3/ Products**

**DareNFT** will show from which NFTs an NFT is generated and how much it is worth compared to the original NFT. At the same time, _NFT 2.0_ supports co-ownership for 1 NFT in order to divide profits among owners fairly. And these NFTs can be backward compatible with NFTs 1.0 ie anyone who owns NFTs 1.0, when transferring NFTs to _NFT 2.0 smart contract_, these NFTs will be added features to become NFTs. 2.0. That leads to _NFT 2.0_ which will have more features, be more attractive and generate more cash flow for holders and generate higher liquidity and demand.

**DarePlay** – _Rental Game Assets Marketplace_: This is the first product of the **DareNFT** team. Since **DareNFT** is an IT infrastructure, they need applications on it to reach end-users.

**DarePlay** features include:

1.  Onboard traditional game into NFT game  
      
    After a period of discussion with non-blockchain game manufacturers, the **DareNFT** team realizes that there is a common need from game makers that they want to participate in blockchain and turn their games into NFT games. This comes from realizing their own game's strengths and wanting to expand and gain more success in the blockchain market. However, due to limited blockchain and NFT knowledge, they have not been able to do this.  
      
    To untangle these barriers, DarePlay will provide:

-   NFT as a service, which provides APIs that allow minting of NFTs based on their game item embryo.
-   IGO Launchpad (similar to IDO): allows them to launch tokens and do a public offering and sell tokens to the public.
-   Create a marketplace that allows them to sell NFTs to the public.  
    This is almost the full package that a traditional game needs to become a NFT game.  
      
    Currently **DareNFT** has _OneSoft_ as a partner waiting for the integration. _OneSoft_ was one of the early investors of **DareNFT**. They are the leading Game Studio in Vietnam and Southeast Asia, and the top 15 game publishers worldwide (based on Q2 2021 report). Besides, there is also _Zytiga_, a famous game studio in Hanoi.  
      
    

3.  Market for exchange and rent - NFT item rental  
    Game item rental - lease model is proving its usefulness. This is still a blue ocean and according to **DareNFT**'s assessment, currently only Yield Guild Games is doing relatively well with a similar rental-leasing model (this is the party that made the scholarship model for Axie). The NFT team found that they could build a universal rental market for all games using **DarePlay**.  
      
    **DarePlay** offers:

-   Allow NFT owners to list their NFT games on the market.
-   Allow them to exchange P2P.
-   Allow them to set rental rates, from which NFT items can be rented again.  
      
    Partners that will participate in this segment include _Zitga_, the game **KnightWar** and the **Planet Sandbox**.  
      
    **DarePlay** will allow users to mint NFT assets in the game and bring those NFTs into the rental market. Players of non-NFT games can have NFT minted from weapons, monsters... in the game they are playing, and displayed in their Metamask wallet. Also, they can lease unused NFT items in the game.

The next product of the team will be: **DareWork** – _Derivative Work Marketplace_: **DareNFT** creates a derivative work marketplace for creators and artists to strengthen copyright issues and get the results it deserves with their gray matter.

Daring to think big and daring to think you can take the next step is often the first step towards doing it.

The team behind DareNFT is a very serious setup, and as of today we have learned **DareNFT** has closed a private and strategic [2.4M Funding Round](https://rada.network/en/post/darenft-closes-private-and-strategic-funding-round-with-24m-from-vcs-and-other-investors) which absolutely puts them in the game as a **very serious contender**.

**DareNFT** and _NFT2.0_ will be very _interesting to follow_ and the market space that **DareNFT** ventures into is heavily connected to the coming **mass market explosion** of _#gamefi_ but on a more _strategic infrastructure_ and _cross-game focus_, so while all the _#gamefi_ start-ups are becoming increasingly successful due to massive new consumer pull to _#play2earn_ DareNFT is trying to become a part of the _evolution_ that follows the **massive growth** of _#gamefi_.

I hope this article gives everyone an overview of **DareNFT** as well as the solutions offered by the company. However, like any other project, solution implementation, market acceptance as well as competition and other objective factors will all contribute to the success of **DareNFT** in the future.
